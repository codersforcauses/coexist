# Frontend server

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It includes a number of other libraries:

- Tailwind for styling
- Tanstack Query for state management and data fetching
- Axios for data fetching
- shadcn/ui for components
- lucide for icons

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
